## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Version Creation Process**

1. **User selects original generation** 
   - From existing quiz or exam
   - Must be completed generation

2. **Available letters calculated**
   ```python
   all_letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
   available_letters = [letter for letter in all_letters 
                       if letter not in existing_versions]
   ```

3. **AI regeneration with same parameters**
   ```python
   version_result = quiz_generator.generate_quiz(
       content=source_content,
       language=original.input_parameters.get('language', 'en'),
       num_questions=original.input_parameters.get('num_questions', 10),
       difficulty=original.input_parameters.get('difficulty', 'medium'),
       question_types=original.input_parameters.get('question_types', ['multiple_choice'])
   )
   ```

4. **Version storage**
   ```python
   version = GenerationVersion.objects.create(
       original_generation=generation,
       version_letter=version_letter,
       generated_content=result,
       variations={'shuffled': True, 'version': version_letter}
   )
   ```
