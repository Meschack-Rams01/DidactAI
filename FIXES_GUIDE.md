# DidactAI System Fixes Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the three major fixes implemented in the DidactAI system:

1. **Logo Display in Exports** - Fixed logo not appearing in exported files
2. **Password Reset Functionality** - Fixed email sending for password reset
3. **Export Question Formatting** - Improved question positioning and page layout

## Fix Details

### 1. Logo Display in Exports ✅

**Problem**: When uploading a logo in the export form, it wouldn't appear in the generated PDF or DOCX files.

**Root Cause**: The export services weren't properly handling the logo path conversion from uploaded files to actual file paths.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced logo path resolution in both PDF and DOCX exporters
- Added proper URL-to-path conversion for uploaded files
- Improved error handling with better fallback placeholders
- Added proper centering and sizing for logos

**Files Modified**:
- `exports/services.py`: Lines 985-1067, 1665-1692

**Testing**:
1. Go to export form and upload a university logo
2. Generate a PDF or DOCX export
3. Verify the logo appears properly centered in the document

### 2. Password Reset Functionality ✅

**Problem**: Password reset emails weren't being sent, users couldn't reset their passwords.

**Root Cause**: Email backend was hardcoded to console backend, which doesn't send actual emails.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed email configuration to automatically detect if SMTP credentials are provided
- If SMTP credentials exist, uses SMTP backend for real email delivery
- If not, falls back to console backend with clear instructions
- Updated .env.example with detailed email configuration instructions

**Files Modified**:
- `didactia_project/settings.py`: Lines 251-270
- `.env.example`: Lines 27-50

**Setup Instructions**:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure email settings:

```bash
# For Gmail (recommended):
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password  # Use App Password, not regular password

# For Outlook/Hotmail:
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-password
```

3. Restart the Django server
4. Test password reset functionality

**Gmail App Password Setup**:
1. Go to Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-factor authentication
3. Go to Security → App passwords
4. Generate an app password for "Mail"
5. Use this app password in EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD

### 3. Export Question Formatting ✅

**Problem**: Questions were splitting across pages, poor spacing, and alignment issues.

**Root Cause**: ReportLab paragraph styles didn't have proper page break control and spacing.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `keepWithNext=1` to question headers to prevent splitting
- Added `keepTogether=1` to options to keep them with questions
- Improved spacing between questions and options
- Better justification and line height settings
- Enhanced page break control for better document flow

**Files Modified**:
- `exports/services.py`: Lines 176-212, 264-391

**Improvements Made**:
- Questions no longer split across pages
- Better justified text alignment
- Improved spacing between elements
- Options stay with their questions
- Professional academic formatting

## Testing the Fixes

### Complete Testing Checklist

1. **Logo Export Test**:
   - [ ] Upload a PNG/JPG logo in export form
   - [ ] Generate PDF export → logo should appear centered at top
   - [ ] Generate DOCX export → logo should appear in document header
   - [ ] Test with different image formats (PNG, JPG)

2. **Password Reset Test**:
   - [ ] Configure email settings in .env file
   - [ ] Restart Django server
   - [ ] Go to login page → "Forgot Password"
   - [ ] Enter email address and submit
   - [ ] Check email for reset link
   - [ ] Click link and reset password
   - [ ] Login with new password

3. **Export Formatting Test**:
   - [ ] Create/use a quiz with 10+ questions
   - [ ] Include different question types (multiple choice, true/false, short answer)
   - [ ] Generate PDF export
   - [ ] Verify questions don't split across pages
   - [ ] Check that spacing looks professional
   - [ ] Verify text is properly justified

### Troubleshooting

**Logo Issues**:
- Check that uploaded file is a valid image format (PNG, JPG, GIF)
- Verify file permissions in media directory
- Check Django logs for image processing errors

**Email Issues**:
- Verify email credentials in .env file
- Check that EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD are set
- Test with Gmail app password (not regular password)
- Check Django console for email sending errors

**Export Issues**:
- Check that ReportLab library is installed
- Verify sufficient disk space for PDF generation
- Check Django logs for export processing errors

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Email Configuration**:
   - Use environment variables for email credentials
   - Never commit email passwords to version control
   - Consider using services like SendGrid or Mailgun for production

2. **File Storage**:
   - Configure proper media file storage (AWS S3, etc.)
   - Set up media file serving for production
   - Ensure logos are accessible at their uploaded URLs

3. **Performance**:
   - PDF generation can be memory-intensive for large documents
   - Consider implementing background task processing (Celery) for exports
   - Set appropriate timeout values for export operations

## Additional Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Email (Required for password reset)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@domain.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-password

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/didactai_db

# AI Services
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key

# File Storage (if using cloud storage)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket
```

### System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.2+
- ReportLab (for PDF exports)
- python-docx (for DOCX exports)
- PostgreSQL (recommended) or SQLite
- Redis (for background tasks, optional)
