Introduction to Computer Science

Chapter 1: What is Computer Science?
Computer science is the study of computational systems, algorithms, and the design of computer systems and their applications. It encompasses both the mathematical and engineering aspects of computing.

Key Topics:
- Programming fundamentals (variables, loops, functions)
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming)
- Computer architecture (CPU, memory, I/O systems)
- Software engineering (design patterns, testing, debugging)
- Database systems (SQL, NoSQL, data modeling)
- Operating systems (processes, threads, memory management)
- Computer networks (protocols, TCP/IP, internet)

Programming Languages:
Computer science involves learning various programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and many others. Each language has its strengths and is suited for different types of applications.

Python: Great for beginners, data science, web development
Java: Enterprise applications, Android development
C++: System programming, game development
JavaScript: Web development, both frontend and backend

Problem Solving:
At its core, computer science is about solving problems efficiently using computational thinking and algorithmic approaches.

Basic Programming Concepts:
1. Variables and Data Types
2. Control Structures (if-else, loops)
3. Functions and Procedures
4. Object-Oriented Programming
5. Error Handling
6. File I/O Operations

Sample Questions:
1. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
2. Explain the concept of Big O notation.
3. What are the advantages of object-oriented programming?
4. How does a hash table work?
5. What is the difference between a stack and a queue?
