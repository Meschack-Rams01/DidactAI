  - Short Answer: Text-based answers
  - True/False: Boolean responses
  - Essay: Extended response requirements

### Question Generation Logic
- Topics are incorporated into question text
- Difficulty affects point values (Easy: 1pt, Medium: 1pt, Hard: 2-3pts)
- Question types cycle through selected types
- Proper explanations and answer keys included

### Data Storage
- All generations stored in `AIGeneration` model
- JSON field stores complete question data
- Proper relationships to courses and users
- Ready for future AI API integration

## 🚀 Next Steps for Production

1. **AI Integration**: Replace fallback generation with real AI API calls
2. **File Upload**: Add support for generating from uploaded documents
3. **Export Features**: Add PDF/Word export functionality
